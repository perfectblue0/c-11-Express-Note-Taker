# c-11-Express-Note-Taker

## Description

My motivation for this project was to modify starter code so that the application would allow users to save and retrieve note data from a Express.js back end. I contributed to this project so that I could practice using Express.js, Uuidv4, Node.js, and learn to deploy an application to Heroku. This application lets users write and save notes so they can organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks they need to complete.
