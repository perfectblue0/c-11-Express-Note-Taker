# c-11-Express-Note-Taker

## Description

My motivation for this project was to modify starter code so that the application would allow users to save and retrieve note data from an Express.js back end. I contributed to this project so that I could practice using Express.js, Uuidv4, Node.js, and learn to deploy an application to Heroku. This application lets users write and save notes so they can organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks they need to complete.

## Usage
Once on the application page users may click the button “Get Started” to go to the note taking page. Users may click on the “Note Title” area and type in the title of their new note. Next users can click on the smaller “Note Text” to write their new note. When users have finished writing their note, they can then click on the save icon located to the left of the “+” that will save their new note. On the left side of the application, users can see their new note title and when they click on the title they will be able to view the title and body of their newly written note, and older notes as well.
